# Rocm 7 Builds
Here I will publish my own ROCm builds for various architectures from TheRock repository.

# Install
Because the Rocm distribution is too large, I'm only posting PyTorch in the [Release section](https://github.com/guinmoon/rocm7_builds/releases).
You can download Rocm Wheels and the Rocm distribution from Google Drive; I've included the links in the releases.

# Build
You can read about how to build your own Rocm distribution in these articles. [EN](https://medium.com/@guinmoon/building-rocm-7-1-and-pytorch-on-windows-for-unsupported-gpus-my-hands-on-guide-0758d2d2b334) [RU](https://habr.com/ru/articles/967998/)
